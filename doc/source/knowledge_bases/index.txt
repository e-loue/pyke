        Knowledge is made up of both *facts* and *rules*.  These are gathered

====================
Knowledge Bases
====================

Knowledge is organized into named repositories called *knowledge bases*.
A knowledge base is like a directory for files on disk, except that knowledge
bases may not be nested.  Therefore, the *entities* within a knowledge base
always have a two-level name: *knowledge_base_name.knowledge_entity_name*.

Here are some examples of facts you might see in a web server application::

    header.cookie('session=123456789;remember=the_alamo')
    cookie.session(123456789)
    cookie.remember(the_alamo)
    header.accept_encoding(gzip)
    header.accept_encoding(deflate)
    request.path('/my/site.html')
    request.path_segment(0, my)
    request.path_segment(1, 'site.html')
    request.path_segment(-2, my)
    request.path_segment(-1, 'site.html')

Note that three different knowledge bases (all `fact bases`_) are shown here
named ``header``, ``cookie``, and ``request``; each with multiple facts.

The second part of the two-part name is the name of the *knowledge entity*.
You can think of knowledge entities as statement_ *types* or *topics*.  So:

    :request:
        is the name of the *knowledge base*.
    :request.path_segment:
        is the name of the *knowledge entity*, or statement topic.
    :request.path_segment(-1, 'site.html'):
        is a specific statement about the topic of request.path_segments.

What do Knowledge Bases Do?
===========================

Ultimately Pyke is interested in proving statements, or answering the question
"Is statement X true"?  There are several different types of knowledge bases.
Each type of knowledge base represents a different way of doing this:

- Those that contain simple lists of statements of fact (as you see in the
  example above) are called `fact bases`_.

  - These determine whether a statement is true by simply checking to see if
    that statement is in their list of known facts. 

- Those that contain *if-then* rules_ are called `rule bases`__.

  - These determine whether a statement is true by running their if-then rules
    to try to construct a proof for that statement.
  - Rule bases may include both forward-chaining_ and backward-chaining_ rules.

- It is also possible to create other kinds of knowledge bases that determine
  the truth of statements in other ways.  Pyke provides two of these:

  - The `question base`_ which just poses the statement to an end user as a
    question.
  - The special_ knowledge base which has several special one-off knowledge
    entities to do different things like run a command_ on the underlying
    system and examine its output and/or exit status.

    - There is only has one instance of this knowledge base -- called
      ``special``.

.. note::

    All knowledge bases share the same name space.  So no two of them,
    regardless of their type, may have the same name.
