====================
Steps to Using Pyke
====================

#. You provide the following to Pyke's `knowledge engine`_:

   - A set of universally true statements_.

     - These statements are true for all time.

   - The text for all questions_ that you might want Pyke to ask your end user.
   - Multiple sets of rules_.

     - Your rules may include both `forward-chaining`_ and
       `backward-chaining`_ rules.

#. Repeat for each specific use case:

   #. You provide a set of statements_ describing this specific use case to
      Pyke.

   #. You select which set of rules apply to this use case.

   #. Pyke automatically runs all of the selected forward-chaining rules that
      apply to the statements that you've given to it to deduce new statements.

      - Your forward-chaining rules may interactively ask your end user
        `questions`_, or get information by executing `commands`_ (programs)
        on the computer that it's running on to help in its decision
        making.

   #. You ask Pyke a question by having it prove_ a goal_ (which is just
      another statement).  This goal may include `pattern variables`_ that
      allow you to ask "for what values is this statement true?".

      - Pyke runs the selected backward-chaining rules against the statements
        that it has in order to figure out the answer to your question.

      - Your backward-chaining rules may also ask your end user questions_ and
        run commands_.

      - You may have written Python code at the end of some of your
        backward-chaining rules.  For each such rule, Pyke has compiled this
        Python code into a Python function called a plan_ which it has attached
        to the rule.

      - Once Pyke finds an answer to your question, it gathers all of the plan
        functions of the rules that it used to find your answer into a
        complete function call graph.  The plan functions are linked together
        mirroring the way that the rules were linked together to find your
        answer.  In this way, you can write high-level compilers that assemble
        together and configure a set of Python functions to solve specific
        problems.

      - Pyke returns the top Python function of this function call graph as a
        standard Python function along with the answer to your question.  You
        may call this function as may times as you like.  You may also pickle_
        the function so that you can send it to another program or save it to
        disk.  You only need one small Pyke module to load and run these
        pickles.

   #. You reset_ Pyke to clear out all of these case specific statements and
      prepare it for the next use case.
