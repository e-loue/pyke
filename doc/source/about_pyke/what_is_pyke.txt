=============================
What is Pyke?
=============================

Pyke integrates a form of `Logic Programming`_ into Python by providing a
knowledge engine that can:

- Do both forward-chaining (data driven) and
  backward-chaining (goal directed) inferencing.

  - Pyke may be embedded into any Python program.

- Automatically generate Python programs by assembling individual Python
  functions into complete call graphs.

  - This is done through a unique design where the individual Python
    functions are attached to backward-chaining rules.
  - Unlike other approaches to code reuse (e.g. Object-oriented programming,
    Zope adapters, generic functions), this allows the inference engine to
    ensure that all of the function's requirements are completely satisfied,
    by examining the entire call graph down to the leaves, before **any** of
    the functions are executed.
  - This is an optional feature.  You don't need to use it if you just
    want the inferencing capability by itself.

The Knowledge Engine Supports:
========================================

- Multiple *fact bases*, each with its own list of facts.
- Both *forward-chaining* rules and *backward-chaining* rules.
- Multiple *rule bases*, each with its own list of forward-chaining
  and/or backward-chaining rules.
- Rule base inheritance -- *activating* the derived rule base 
  includes the rules from the parent rule base.
- The inference rules are compiled into Python functions, allowing 
  Python code snippets to be used within the rules.
  This greatly enhances the expressiveness of the rules.

Automatic Program Generation:
========================================

- Calls the generated Python programs *plans*.
- Plans may be run multiple times without needing to rerun the inference
  rules.
- Plans may be pickled and cached to disk to be used by other programs or
  in later runs of the same program.
- Only one small Pyke module is required to run the plans.

Potential Pyke Applications:
========================================

- Complicated decision making applications.
- The back-end (code generation and optimization) of compilers.
  Pyke is used as the back-end of its own
  compiler that translates rules into Python code.
- Automatic SQL statement generation.
- Automatic HTML generation and automatic HTML template processing.
- Automatic program builder to reuse a common set of functions for many
  different specific situations.  This could also easily
  incorporate a new custom function into a much larger program, where the use
  of the custom function might influence the choice of other standard
  functions in other parts of the program.
- The control module for a web framework tool.
- A high-level planner to automatically distribute the
  modules of a large system over several computers in a distributed system
  to meet specific performance and capacity goals.  This could be used to
  automatically scale the same system code from a small one program,
  one computer system
  to much larger distributed systems to meet a wide range of performance
  goals.
- Diagnosis systems, including automated customer service systems.
- Program or library customization for specific uses.
- In addition to being able to build programs, Pyke can instantiate,
  configure and interconnect a network of objects to meet a specific need
  or situation.
