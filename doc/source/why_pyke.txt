============
Why Pyke?
============
-------------------------
What Does Pyke Do for Me?
-------------------------

Pyke was primarily designed to allow you to "cook" your Python_ code.  You
write Python code, and then you write Pyke code to cook that Python
code -- i.e. to assemble the Python functions that you've written and
customize them for a specific situation or use-case.

Pyke can also be used for difficult decision making applications where each
part of the problem has multiple possible solutions and the selection of a
solution to one part of the problem affects whether another part of the problem
can be solved or not.  Examples of these kind of applications are listed on
the `home page`_.


Examples of "Cooking" Python Code
=================================

Database Access Library
-----------------------

You're writing a library package to make it easier for Python programmers to
access relational databases.  You write Python code that deals with the
mechanics of accessing relational databases, and then you write Pyke code to
make a cooked version of this code for each database access with your user's
application.

You might also use Pyke to provide help installing and configuring the
database and help creating the schema.

By taking this approach, your library will be an order of magnitude faster
than competing database access libraries because you've used Pyke to
essentially compile custom code for each database access.

The sqlgen_ example demonstates this approach.


HTML Templating Library
-----------------------

Or you're writing an HTML templating package to make it easier for Python
programmers to generate HTML.  You write Python code that deals with the
mechanics of HTML, and then you write Pyke code to make a cooked version of
this code for each HTML template.

By taking this approach, your library will be an order of magnitude faster
than competing HTML templating libraries because you've used Pyke to
essentially compile custom code for each HTML template.

The web_framework_ example demonstates this approach.  It uses the sqlgen_
example to make a little web framework.  The 2 HTML templates in this example
were also done in TurboGears 2 and then a siege_ benchmark test done on both:

- TurboGears 2 ran 75.83 transactions/sec
- The Pyke example ran 791.01 transactions/sec


Linux Configuration Program
---------------------------

Or you're writing a new Linux configuration program.  You write the Python
code to query and set the various system configuration options, and then you
write Pyke code to ask the user what he wants and build a cooked version of
your code to make the necessary changes.

In this case, you're not looking for performance.  You use Pyke to handle the
complicated decision making and use its plan_ facility to postpone making any
configuration changes until your program is sure that it's "dotted all of the
I's and crossed all the T's".


Summary
=======

Pyke provides a way to directly "program in the large", which dovetails with
using Python to "program in the small".  Pyke supplements but does not replace
Python!

Pyke helps programmers to achieve order of magnitude improvements in:

- Adaptability/Customization

  - Using Pyke allows your Python code to be combined into thousands of
    different configurations.

  - Thus, your application or library takes on the characteristics of a
    Domain Specific Language to achieve an order of magnitude increase in
    adaptability without a corresponding increase your program's "surface
    area" to your users.

- Performance

  - Thinking of your application or library as a Domain Specific Language
    (DSL), you're using Pyke to "compile" rather than "interpret" your DSL to
    achieve an order of magnitude improvement in performance.

- Code Reuse

  - Making your code an order of magnitude more adaptable and an order of
    magnitude faster allows it to be (re)used in a correspondingly broader
    range of situations.
