Proving Goals
===================================

.. this code is hidden and will set __file__ to the doc/examples directory.
   >>> import os
   >>> __file__ = \
   ...   os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())),
   ...                'examples')
   >>> from pyke import knowledge_engine
   >>> my_engine = knowledge_engine.engine(__file__)
   >>> my_engine.add_universal_fact('family', 'son_of', ('bruce', 'thomas'))
   >>> my_engine.add_universal_fact('family', 'son_of', ('david', 'bruce'))
   >>> my_engine.activate('bc_related0')

Though Pyke has the capability to return multiple answers to a single goal,
often you just want the first answer:

*some_engine*.prove_1_goal(goal, \*\*args)
    ``goal`` is a Pyke goal (as a string).  This may include `pattern
    variables`_ (which start with a '$').

    >>> my_engine.prove_1_goal('bc_related0.father_son(thomas, david, $depth)')
    ({'depth': ('grand',)}, None)

    Returns the first proof found as a 2-tuple: a dict of bindings for the
    pattern variables, and a plan_.  The plan is ``None`` if no plan was
    generated; otherwise, it is a Python function as described here__.

.. __: other_functions.html#running-and-pickling-plans

    Args must be specified as keyword arguments and are set as the value of
    the corresponding pattern variable.

    >>> vars, plan = \
    ...   my_engine.prove_1_goal('bc_related0.father_son($father, $son, $depth)',
    ...                          father='thomas',
    ...                          son='david')
    >>> sorted(vars.items(), key=lambda item: item[0])
    [('depth', ('grand',)), ('father', 'thomas'), ('son', 'david')]

    Prove_1_goal raises ``pyke.knowledge_engine.CanNotProve`` if no proof is
    found:

    >>> my_engine.prove_1_goal('bc_related0.father_son(thomas, bogus, $depth)')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    CanNotProve: Can not prove bc_related0.father_son(thomas, bogus, $depth)

*some_engine*.prove_goal(goal, \*\*args)
    This returns a context manager for a generator yielding 2-tuples, as
    above.  Unlike ``prove_1_goal`` it does not raise an exception if no
    proof is found:

    >>> from __future__ import with_statement

    >>> with my_engine.prove_goal(
    ...        'bc_related0.father_son(thomas, $son, $depth)') as gen:
    ...     for vars, plan in gen:
    ...         print vars['son'], vars['depth']
    bruce ()
    david ('grand',)

    Like ``prove_1_goal``, above, `pattern variables`_ in the goal_ may be
    specified with keyword arguments:

    >>> with my_engine.prove_goal(
    ...        'bc_related0.father_son($father, $son, $depth)',
    ...        father='thomas') as gen:
    ...     for vars, plan in gen:
    ...         print vars['son'], vars['depth']
    bruce ()
    david ('grand',)

Compiling Goals at Program Startup
==================================

Similar to Python's regular expression library, ``re``, you may compile your
goal statements once at program startup:

    >>> from pyke import goal

    >>> my_goal = goal.compile('bc_related0.father_son($father, $son, $depth)')

Then use ``my_goal.prove_1`` and ``my_goal.prove`` as many times as you'd
like:

    >>> vars, plan = my_goal.prove_1(my_engine, father='thomas', son='david')
    >>> sorted(vars.items(), key=lambda item: item[0])
    [('depth', ('grand',)), ('father', 'thomas'), ('son', 'david')]

    >>> with my_goal.prove(my_engine, father='thomas') as gen:
    ...     for vars, plan in gen:
    ...         print vars['son'], vars['depth']
    bruce ()
    david ('grand',)
