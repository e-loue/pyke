===================================
Asserting New Facts
===================================

*some_engine*.add_universal_fact(kb_name, fact_name, arguments)
    The ``add_universal_fact`` function is called once per fact_.  These
    facts_ are never deleted and apply to all *cases*.
    
    Alternatively, you can place universal facts in a `.kfb file`_ so that
    they are loaded automatically.

    >>> my_engine.add_universal_fact('family', 'son_of', ('bruce', 'thomas'))

    Multiple facts with the same name are allowed.

    >>> my_engine.add_universal_fact('family', 'son_of', ('david', 'bruce'))

    But duplicate facts (with the same arguments) are silently ignored.

    >>> my_engine.add_universal_fact('family', 'son_of', ('david', 'bruce'))
    >>> my_engine.get_kb('family').dump_universal_facts()
    son_of('bruce', 'thomas')
    son_of('david', 'bruce')

    These facts are accessed as ``kb_name.fact_name(arguments)`` within the
    `.krb files`_.


*some_engine*.assert_(kb_name, fact_name, arguments)
    Call ``assert_`` for each starting fact_ for this case.  Like universal
    facts, you may have multiple facts with the same name so long as they
    have different arguments.

    >>> my_engine.assert_('family', 'son_of', ('michael', 'bruce'))
    >>> my_engine.assert_('family', 'son_of', ('fred', 'thomas'))
    >>> my_engine.assert_('family', 'son_of', ('fred', 'thomas'))

    Duplicates with universal facts are also ignored.

    >>> my_engine.assert_('family', 'son_of', ('bruce', 'thomas'))
    >>> my_engine.get_kb('family').dump_specific_facts()
    son_of('michael', 'bruce')
    son_of('fred', 'thomas')
    >>> my_engine.get_kb('family').dump_universal_facts()
    son_of('bruce', 'thomas')
    son_of('david', 'bruce')

    There is no difference within the `.krb files`_ of how universal facts
    verses case specific facts are used.  The only difference between the two
    types of facts is that the case specific facts are deleted when a ``reset``
    is done.

    >>> my_engine.reset()
    >>> my_engine.get_kb('family').dump_specific_facts()
    >>> my_engine.get_kb('family').dump_universal_facts()
    son_of('bruce', 'thomas')
    son_of('david', 'bruce')
