==========
KQB Syntax
==========

This uses a different lexical structure than `KRB files`_.  Textual parameter
substitution is done with the standard Python `string.Template`_ class, which
specifies parameters with a ``$``, much like `pattern variables`_.  In the
following descriptions, substitution parameters are acted upon in
``PARAMETRIZED_TEXT``, but not in ``TEXT``.

The name of the `question base`_ is simple the filename with the ``.kqb``
suffix stripped.  This must be a valid Python identifier.


PARAMETRIZED_TEXT
==================

``PARAMETRIZED_TEXT`` may span multiple lines.  Each subsequent line must
be indented at least as much as the first character of ``PARAMETRIZED_TEXT``
on the first line.  Line breaks and indentation are preserved.  So syntax
like::

    match '!' PARAMETRIZED_TEXT

Could be::

    2-10 ! This is the start of the
           parametrized text.
           ^
           |
           +------ all lines must be indented at least this far!

              - what do you think?

The ``PARAMETRIZED_TEXT`` here would be::

    This is the start of the
    parametrized text.
    ^
    |
    +------ all lines must be indented at least this far!

       - what do you think?

But this is not legal::

    2-10 ! An example of PARAMETRIZED_TEXT
          with a second line that's not indented enough!


Syntax for KQB File
===================

::

    file ::= [NL] {question}

    question ::= IDENTIFIER '(' [{parameter,}] ')' NL INDENT
                    {PARAMETRIZED_TEXT NL}
                    '---' NL
                    parameter '=' question_type
                 DEINDENT

    parameter ::= '$' IDENTIFIER

Each question has a name and a fixed number of parameters.  This is followed
by one or more lines of ``PARAMETRIZED_TEXT`` that will be presented as the
question to answer.  These are terminated by a line containing only ``---``.

One of the parameters is designated as the *answer* parameter on the line
immediately following the terminating ``---``.  This is the only parameter
that may be unbound when a rule uses this question.

For example, the file ``user_questions.kqb`` might contain::

    ate($meal, $ans)
        Did you eat $meal?
        ---
        $ans = yn

This question could be referenced in the premise_ of a rule_ as::

    user_questions.ate(lunch, $ans)

or::

    user_questions.ate(lunch, False)

But not::

    user_questions.ate($meal, False)

There are several different kinds of ``question_types``, each corresponding to
a different way that the user might answer the question::

    question_type ::= yn_type
                    | integer_type
                    | number_type
                    | float_type
                    | string_type
                    | select_1_type
                    | select_n_type


The ``integer_type``, ``number_type``, ``float_type`` and ``string_type`` may
include a match_ to force the user to enter a sensible answer.

All of these may also include a review_, which is just ``PARAMETRIZED_TEXT``
that will be displayed when the user's answer matches a certain match_ value.

Question_type links:

- yn_type_
- integer_type_
- number_type_
- float_type_
- string_type_
- select_1_type_
- select_n_type_

YN_type
=======

::

    yn_type ::= 'yn' NL [review]

The user answers "yes" or "no".  The answer returned is True or False.  If the
`ask_tty`_ module is used, the user may type "yes", "y", "true" or "t" for
True and "no", "n", "false", or "f" for False.  These are case insensitive.

Example::

    ate($meal, $ans)
        Did you eat $meal?
        ---
        $ans = yn

See review_, below.


Integer_type
============

::

    integer_type ::= 'integer' ['(' match ')'] NL [review]

The user enters an integer.  If the match_ is specified, the integer must
match it or the user is asked to try again.

Example::

    hours_since_last_meal($ans)
        How many hours has it been since you last ate?
        ---
        $ans = integer(0-48)

See review_, below.


Number_type
============

::

    number_type ::= 'number' ['(' match ')'] NL [review]

The user enters either an integer or a floating point number.  If the user
enters an integer, a Python ``int`` is returned.  Otherwise a Python ``float``
is returned.

If the match_ is specified, the number must match it or the user is asked
to try again.

Example::

    miles_to($dest, $ans)
        How many miles did you travel to get to $dest?
        ---
        $ans = number(0.1-3000)

See review_, below.


Float_type
============

::

    float_type ::= 'float' ['(' match ')'] NL [review]


The user enters an integer or a floating point number.  But the answer
returned is always a Python ``float``.

If the match_ is specified, the number must match it or the user is asked
to try again.

Example::

    price($object, $price)
        What did you pay for $object?
        ---
        $price = float

See review_, below.


String_type
============

::

    string_type ::= 'string' ['(' match ')'] NL [review]

The user enters a string (text).  If the match_ is specified, the string must
match it or the user is asked to try again.

Example::

    users_name($name)
        What's your name?
            - Please don't enter a fictitious (screen) name.
        ---
        $name = string(2-40)

See review_, below.


Match
=====

There are several kinds of simple_matches that may be or-ed together with
``|``::

    match ::= simple_match {'|' simple_match}

The match succeeds if any of the ``simple_matches`` succeed.

::

    simple_match ::= '(' match ')'
                   | [ STRING ] [ '[' TEXT ']' ] '/' REGEXP_TEXT '/'
                   | [NUMBER] '-' NUMBER
                   | NUMBER '-'
                   | value '=' simple_match
                   | value

Regexp Match
------------

::

    simple_match ::= [ STRING ] [ '[' TEXT ']' ] '/' REGEXP_TEXT '/'

A regexp match can only be used with string_type_ questions.  It matches if
the regexp matches.

If the regexp contains a single group, that group is returned as the
question's answer rather than the entire string.

If the regexp contains multiple groups, a tuple of the groups is returned as
the question's answer rather than entire string.

If STRING is specified on a regexp, it is used in the error message if the
regexp fails.  The error message is "Answer should be $error_msg, got $string".

If '[' TEXT ']' is specified on a regexp, it is used in the prompt for the
end user to inform him of what is expected.  Generally, this prompt message
is enclosed in '[' and ']' when it is displayed to the user.

Example::

    state_code($state)
        Enter your two digit state code.
        ---
        $state = string('uppercase'[uppercase]/[A-Z][A-Z]/)

Range Match
-----------

::

    simple_match ::= [NUMBER] '-' NUMBER
                   | NUMBER '-'

A range match has a '-' in it.  It matches if the answer is between the two
values.  If either value is omitted, that limit is not tested.  If matched to
a string, it matches the length of the string.

Example::

    age($years)
        How old are you?
        ---
        $years = integer(1-130)

Value '=' Match
---------------

::

    simple_match ::= value '=' simple_match

The '=' means "substituted for".  The match_ fails if the match after the '='
fails.  Otherwise it returns the value before the '=' rather than what the
user entered.  Note that you can or (``|``) several of these together to
translate several different matched values.

Example::

    age_category($period_of_life)
        How old are you?
        ---
        $period_of_life = integer(child=1-12 |
                                  teenager=13-19 |
                                  young_adult=20-35 |
                                  middle_age=35-64 |
                                  elder=65-130)


Value Match
-----------

::

    simple_match ::= value

    value ::= STRING | IDENTIFIER | NUMBER | 'None' | 'True' | 'False'

A value match, only matches that one value.  An IDENTIFIER is treated as a
STRING.  These are mostly used in reviews.


Review
======

::

    review ::= {match '!' PARAMETRIZED_TEXT NL}

All of the ``reviews`` must be at the same indent level.

The review is applied after the answer has been validated (validation possibly
changes the value).

Each match_ is checked and all of the matching review's ``PARAMETRIZED_TEXT``
messages are displayed to the user.

Examples::

    stupid_question($ans)
        Can you answer a question
        that is several lines long?
        ---
        $ans = yn
            True  ! Correct!  This is true because the
                              sky is blue!
            False ! Nope!  Remember that the sky is blue!

    wood($ans)
        How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
        ---
        $ans = integer(0-100) 
            -10   ! more than that!
            10-20 ! bingo!
            21-   ! I guess they're not as strong as you think ...

.. This code is hidden.  It will add '' to sys.path, change to the doc.examples
   directory and store the directory path in __file__ for the code section
   following:
   >>> import sys
   >>> if '' not in sys.path: sys.path.insert(0, '')
   >>> import os
   >>> os.chdir("../../examples")
   >>> __file__ = os.getcwd()

Asking ``stupid_question`` and answering "y" to it::

    >>> from pyke import knowledge_engine

    >>> engine = knowledge_engine.engine(__file__)

    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> import sys
    >>> class echo(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, f): self.f = f
    ...     def readline(self):
    ...         ans = self.f.readline()
    ...         sys.stdout.write(ans)
    ...         return ans
    >>> sys.stdin = echo(StringIO('y\n'))

displays::

    >>> engine.prove_1_goal('user_questions.stupid_question($ans)')
    ______________________________________________________________________________
    Can you answer a question
    that is several lines long? (y/n) y
    Correct!  This is true because the
              sky is blue!
    ({'ans': True}, None)


Select_1_type
=============

::

    select_1_type ::= 'select_1' NL alternatives

This is a multiple choice question.  The alternatives_ are displayed to the
user, and he picks one (and only one).

Example::

    another_question($arg1, $arg2, $ans)
        question text with $arg1 stuff in it.
        on multiple lines
            - possibly indented
            - for who knows what reason...
                - maybe for $arg2?
        ---
        $ans = select_1
            1: prompt for this selection with $arg2 in it too
               which can span multiple lines
                   - and be indented ...
               ! Nope!  Remember that the sky is blue!
            2: next prompt
               ! =1     # same review as 1:
            3: pick me! pick me!!!
               ! Correct!  You certainly know about $arg1!
                 yep, multiple review lines too...
                    - and indented...


Select_n_type
=============

::

    select_n_type ::= 'select_n' NL alternatives

This is a multiple choice question.  The alternatives_ are displayed to the
user, and he picks as many as he likes.

Example::

    problems($list)
        Which of these problems are you experiencing?
            - select all that apply
        ---
        $list = select_n
            boot: The system won't boot.
            os: I hate Windows!
            internet: I can't connect to the internet.
            slow: The system is running too slow.
            ouch: Help!  I've fallen and I can't get up!
            freeze: The system freezes or does not respond to input.
            printer: The printer doesn't work.
            senile: What's email?

Alternatives
============

::

    alternatives ::= {value ':' PARAMETRIZED_TEXT NL [alt_review]}

All of the ``alternatives`` must be at the same indent level.

The user only sees the ``PARAMETRIZED_TEXT`` values.  The ``value``
associated with the selected ``PARAMETRIZED_TEXT`` is returned (but the user
never sees it).  The ``value`` *tags* the alternative.

::

    alt_review ::= '!' '=' value NL
                 | '!' PARAMETRIZED_TEXT NL

Each alternative may have it's own review associated with it.

The ``'!' '=' value`` form uses the same review text as the previous
alternative with that *tag*.  Note that this can not refer forward to a
following alternative.

The second form specifies the review text for this alternative directly.
