=====================
Python Premise Syntax
=====================

Python_premise
==============

::

    python_premise ::= pattern '=' python_exp
                     | pattern 'in' python_exp
                     | 'check' python_exp
                     | python_statements

Each of these clauses results in a Python expression being executed.  Their
meaning is as follows:

pattern_ '=' python_exp
    *python_exp* is evaluated and the result matched_ with pattern_.
    If the result does not match, the clause fails.

    The clause always fails on backtracking_, meaning that it only produces
    a single result (contrasted with ``in``).
pattern_ 'in' python_exp
    *python_exp* is evaluated to produce a Python *iterable* and the first
    element from the resulting iterable is matched_ with pattern_.  On
    backtracking_, successive elements from the iterable are matched with
    pattern_.  When the result is exhausted, the clause fails.

    This has the effect of offering each element of the result, one at a
    time, to the subsequent premise clauses.  Each element is thus acted upon
    individually.
'check' python_exp
    *python_exp* is evaluated.  If the result is Python "true" the clause
    succeeds, otherwise it fails.  The clause always fails on backtracking_.


Python_statements
===================

::

    python_statements ::= 'python' python_statement
                        | 'python' NL INDENT
                              {python_statement NL}
                          DEINDENT

This clause allows the inclusion of arbitrary Python statements in your
rules_.  This premise always succeeds; and then fails on backtracking_.

.. caution::

   Always keep in mind the difference between `pattern variables`_ and
   *Python variables*.  Pattern variables are always indicated with a ``$``
   and are only bound to a value during inferencing.

   #. Thus, a ``python_statement`` may not set a pattern variable.  Storing a
      value computed by Python into a pattern variable can only be done using
      the python_premise::

          <pattern> = <some python expression>
   
   #. When a pattern variable is used within a Python expression or statement,
      it must be `fully bound`_.

   #. Python variables are not visible to the inference engine.  They are local
      variables that are also not visible to Python code in other rules_ or
      other invocations of the same rule.

   #. Finally, Python variables in the `when clause`_ of a `backward-chaining
      rule`_ are not visible to the Python code in the `with clause`_ of the
      same rule.  (These end up in two different Python functions after the
      `.krb file`_ is compiled).  So this won't work::

          some_bc_rule
              use some_goal(...)
              when
                  ...
                  python x_list = <some python expression>
                  ...
              with
                  for x in x_list: process(x)

      In this case, assign the value of the Python variable to a pattern
      variable in the when clause and then use that pattern variable in the
      with clause::

          some_bc_rule
              use some_goal(...)
              when
                  ...
                  python x_list = <some python expression>
                  ...
                  $x_list = tuple(x_list)
              with
                  for x in $x_list: process(x)
