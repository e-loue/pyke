=============================================
Compound Premise Syntax
=============================================

There are three kinds of compound premises.  These can be used in both
`forward-chaining rules`_ and `backward-chaining rules`_, but the nested
premises within each of these are restricted to the kind of premises legal
for that kind of rule: fc_premise_ for forward-chaining rules, and
bc_premise_ for backward-chaining rules.

::

    compound_premise ::= first_premise
                       | forall_premise
                       | notany_premise

First Premise
=====================

The ``first`` premise is used to prevent backtracking_ from finding subsequent
solutions to a set of premises.  The ``first`` premise always fails on
backtracking (but does do backtracking *within* the nested premises).

::

    first_premise ::= ['!'] 'first' premise
                    | ['!'] 'first' NL
                              INDENT
                                 {premise NL}
                              DEINDENT

The ``!`` option can only be used in backward-chaining rules.

When used within backward-chaining rules, the nested premises may include any
type of plan_spec_.

Forall Premise
=====================

The ``forall`` premise forces backtracking_ within the nested premises to
process all of the possible solutions found before the ``forall`` succeeds.
After the first success, the ``forall`` fails on backtracking.

::

    forall_premise ::= 'forall' NL
                         INDENT
                            {premise NL}
                         DEINDENT
                     [ 'require' NL
                         INDENT
                            {premise NL}
                         DEINDENT ]

The premises within the ``require`` clause are tried for each solution found
to the ``forall`` clause.  If these fail for any solution, then the entire
``forall`` premise fails.  Thus, the ``forall`` only succeeds if the
``require`` premises are true for *all* solutions generated within the
``forall`` clause.  Thus, the ``forall`` clause may be read: "Forall X,
require Y".

The ``forall`` always succeeds if the ``require`` clause is omitted (even if
no solutions are found to the nested premises).  This can be used in
conjunction with python_statements_ to gather a list of results.

See `Notes on Forall and Notany Premises`_ and Examples_, below.

Notany Premise
=====================

The ``notany`` premise only succeeds if no solution can be found to the nested
premises.  ``Notany`` always fails on backtracking_.

::

    notany_premise ::= 'notany' NL
                         INDENT
                            {premise NL}
                         DEINDENT

See `Notes on Forall and Notany Premises`_ and Examples_, below.

Notes on Forall and Notany Premises
======================================

#. All `pattern variable`_ bindings made during the execution of a ``forall``
   or ``notany`` premise are undone before the premises following the
   ``forall`` or ``notany`` are run.
   Thus, ``forall`` and ``notany`` can be used to test
   values produced by prior premises; but to generate values for subsequent
   premises the values must be captured in Python variables within the
   ``forall`` or ``notany`` clause before the `pattern variables` are unbound
   (see `Computing a Value for Each Generated Value`_, below).

#. When used within `backward-chaining rules`_, the only plan_spec_ allowed in
   nested premises is the ``as`` clause.

Examples
=============

- `Finding the First Solution From a Set of Values`_
- `Testing Every Generated Value`_
- `Computing a Value for Each Generated Value`_
- `Iterating on Tuples`_
- `Computing Values for All Generated Values that Pass a Test`_

These examples use the following subgoals:

* ``generate_x($x)`` generates multiple solutions (as ``$x``) that will be
  looped over
* ``test_x($x)`` does some test on ``$x``
* ``compute_y($x, $y)`` takes ``$x`` as input and computes a ``$y`` value

Finding the First Solution From a Set of Values
-------------------------------------------------

If you want the first ``$x`` that passes the ``test_x($x)`` test, you have two
options::

    generate_x($x)
    test_x($x)
    ...

And::

    first
        generate_x($x)
        test_x($x)
    ...

The difference is that the first example will find other ``$x`` values that
pass ``test_x($x)`` on backtracking_, while the second example will stop after
the first value is found and fail on backtracking.

Testing Every Generated Value
-----------------------------

There are two general cases.  You might want to verify that ``test_x($x)``
*succeeds* for all generated ``$x`` values::

    forall
        generate_x($x)
    require
        test_x($x)

.. Note::

   While ``$x`` is set and used within the ``forall`` premise to transfer
   values from the ``generate_x($x)`` goal to the ``test_x($x)`` goal, it is
   no longer set afterwards and can not be referenced in the premises
   following the ``forall`` premise.

The second case that you might want to verify is that ``test_x($x)`` *fails*
for every generated ``$x`` value::

    forall
        generate_x($x)
    require
        notany
            test_x($x)

Or, more simply::

    notany
        generate_x($x)
        test_x($x)

Computing a Value for Each Generated Value
------------------------------------------

If you want a tuple of computed ``$y`` values for all of the ``$x`` values::

    python y_list = []
    forall
        generate_x($x)
    require
        compute_x($x, $y)
        python y_list.append($y)
    $y_list = tuple(y_list)

This will only succeed if ``compute_y`` succeeds for every ``$x`` value.

If you want to skip over ``$x`` values that ``compute_y`` fails on, you
*might* try::

    python y_list = []
    forall
        generate_x($x)
        compute_x($x, $y)
        python y_list.append($y)
    $y_list = tuple(y_list)

But note that if ``compute_y`` computes multiple solutions for a single
``$x`` value on backtracking_, you would end up including all of these
solutions in your ``$y_list``.  To only get the first computed value for each
``$x`` value::

    python y_list = []
    forall
        generate_x($x)
        first
            compute_x($x, $y)
            python y_list.append($y)
    $y_list = tuple(y_list)

Iterating on Tuples
-------------------

A simple common case of ``generate_x`` is when you are computing values for
each element of a tuple::

    python y_list = []
    forall
        $x in $x_list
    require
        compute_x($x, $y)
        python y_list.append($y)
    $y_list = tuple(y_list)

This can also be done by creating a new subgoal that recurses on ``$x_list``.
If you call the new subgoal ``compute_list``, you would use it like this::

    compute_list($x_list, $y_list)

And define it like this::

    compute_list_done
        use compute_list((), ())

    compute_list_step
        use compute_list(($x, *$x_rest), ($y, *$y_rest))
        when
            compute_y($x, $y)
            compute_list($x_rest, $y_rest)

.. important::

   Note that there is an important difference between these two examples if
   ``compute_y`` may find alternate ``$y`` values for any given ``$x`` value
   on backtracking_.

   The first example will only generate one ``$y_list``.  If that ``$y_list``
   doesn't work for subsequent premises, the ``forall`` fails on backtracking,
   so no overall solution will be found.

   The second example will not fail in this situation, but will produce all
   possible combinations of solutions to ``compute_y`` for each ``$x`` on
   backtracking until a resulting ``$y_list`` satisfies the subsequent
   premises so that an overall solution *is* found.

Computing Values for All Generated Values that Pass a Test
----------------------------------------------------------

Finally, if you want to gather only the computed ``$y`` values for ``$x``
values that pass ``test_x($x)``::

    python y_list = []
    forall
        generate_x($x)
        test_x($x)
    require
        compute_x($x, $y)
        python y_list.append($y)
    $y_list = tuple(y_list)
