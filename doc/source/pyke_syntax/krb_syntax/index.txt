This section describes the syntax for defining rules_ in KRB files.

Syntax of the Entire KRB File
===================================

::

    file ::= [NL]

             ['extending' IDENTIFIER ['without' {IDENTIFIER,}] NL]

             [{fc_rule}
              ['fc_extras' NL INDENT
                 {<python_statement> NL}
               DEINDENT]]

             [{bc_rule}
              ['bc_extras' NL INDENT
                 {<python_statement> NL}
               DEINDENT]
              ['plan_extras' NL INDENT
                 {<python_statement> NL}
               DEINDENT]]

The KRB file has three optional parts.  It must contain at least one rule_
(either forward-chaining_ or backward-chaining_).

The filename (minus the .krb extension) is the name of the `rule base`_.
This must be a legal Python identifier.

Extending clause
-----------------

The optional ``extending`` clause, if used, is the first line of the file.
This defines the parent `rule base`_ that this `rule base`_ inherits_ from.
It may also specify a list of backward-chaining_ goal names to be excluded
from this inheritance.

Forward-Chaining Section
--------------------------

If the krb file contains any forward-chaining_ rules_, a Python source file
will be created named <rb_name>_fc.py, where <rb_name> is the `rule base`_
name.

The syntax of a forward-chaining_ rule_ (fc_rule_) is defined elsewhere__.

The ``fc_extras`` can only be used if there are forward-chaining_ rules_.
This allows you to add other Python code (for example, ``import`` statements)
to the generated Python source file.

.. __: fc_rule_

Backward-Chaining Section
--------------------------

If the krb file contains any backward-chaining_ rules_, a Python source file
will be created named <rb_name>_bc.py, where <rb_name> is the `rule base`_
name.

The syntax of a backward-chaining_ rule_ (bc_rule_) is defined elsewhere__.

The ``bc_extras`` can only be used if there are backward-chaining_ rules_.
This allows you to add other Python code (for example, ``import`` statements)
to the generated Python source file.

In addition, if any of the backward-chaining_ rules_ have plan_ code (for
example, a ``with`` clause or subgoals in the ``when`` clause that produce
plans_), a Python source file will be created name <rb_name>_plans.py, where
<rb_name> is the `rule base`_ name.

You use the ``plan_extras`` to include arbitrary Python code in this plans
file.
