=============================================
Pattern Syntax
=============================================

Pattern
============

::

    pattern ::= 'None' | 'True' | 'False'
              | NUMBER | IDENTIFIER | STRING | variable
              | '(' [{pattern,}] ['*' variable] ')'

IDENTIFIER acts like a STRING here, meaning that it is taken as a literal
value.  All variables in patterns must be preceded by a ``$``.

Pyke does not currently support complex NUMBERS (for no good reason -- email
me if you need them).

Pattern Variable
===================

`Pattern variables`__ are simply called *variable* in the syntax::

    variable ::= '$'IDENTIFIER

The variable must not have a space between the ``$`` and the ``IDENTIFIER``.

.. __: `pattern variable lp`_

Anonymous Variable
====================

If the pattern variable IDENTIFIER begins with an underscore (_), the variable
is an `anonymous variable`__.  It acts like a "don't care".  Technically, this
means that multiple uses of the same IDENTIFIER may stand for different
values.  The name of the IDENTIFIER after the underscore is ignored and may be
used to document the use of the anonymous variable.

.. __: `anonymous variable lp`_

Rest Variable
================

The ``*variable`` at the end of a tuple pattern will match the rest of the
tuple.  Thus, ``variable`` is *always* bound to a (possibly empty) tuple.

The syntax is taken from rest parameter syntax in Python function definitions.
The difference here is that the variable needs a ``$`` on it.

You may use either a named variable or an anonymous variable here.
