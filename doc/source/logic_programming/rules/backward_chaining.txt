=============================================
Backward Chaining
=============================================

Backward chaining rules_ are processed when your program asks Pyke a question_
(i.e., asks Pyke to prove_ a specific *goal*).  Pyke will only use activated_
`rule bases`_ to do the proof.

Overview of "Backward-Chaining"
===============================

To do backward-chaining, Pyke finds rules whose *then* part matches the *goal*
(i.e., the question).  Once it finds such a rule, it tries to (recursively)
prove all of the subgoals in the *if* part of that rule.  Some of these
subgoals are matched against facts, and others are subgoals for other
backward-chaining rules.  If all of the subgoals can be proven, the rule
succeeds and the original goal is proven.  Otherwise, the rule fails, and Pyke
tries to find another rule whose *then* part matches the goal, and so on.

So Pyke ends up linking (or *chaining*) the *if* part of the first rule to the
*then* part of the next rule.

Reviewing:

#. Pyke starts by finding a rule whose *then* part matches the goal.
#. Pyke then proceeds to process the *if* part of that rule.
#. Which may link (or chain) to the *then* part of another rule.

Since Pyke processes these rules from *then* to *if* to *then* to *if* in the
reverse manner that we normally think of using rules, it's called *backward*
chaining.

To make this more clear, Pyke has you write your backward-chaining rules
upside down by writing the *then* part first (since that's how it is
processed).

"Use", "When" Rather than "Then", "If"
======================================

But *then-if* rules sound confusing, so Pyke uses the words **use** and
**when** rather than **then** and **if**.  You can then read the rule as "use"
this statement "when" these other statements can be proven.

.. note::

   Unlike the *assert* clause in forward-chaining_ rules, Pyke only allows
   one statement in the *use* clause.

Example
=================

Consider this example::

     1  direct_father_son
     2      use father_son($father, $son, ())
     3      when
     4          family.son_of($son, $father)
        
     5  grand_father_son
     6      use father_son($grand_father, $grand_son, (grand))
     7      when
     8          father_son($father, $grand_son, ())
     9          father_son($grand_father, $father, ())
        
    10  great_grand_father_son
    11      use father_son($gg_father, $gg_son, (great, $prefix1, *$rest_prefixes))
    12      when
    13          father_son($father, $gg_son, ())
    14          father_son($gg_father, $father, ($prefix1, *$rest_prefixes))

    15  brothers
    16      use brothers($brother1, $brother2)
    17      when
    18          father_son($father, $brother1, ())
    19          father_son($father, $brother2, ())
    20          check $brother1 != $brother2

    21  uncle_nephew
    22      use uncle_nephew($uncle, $nephew, $prefix)
    23      when
    24          brothers($uncle, $father)
    25          father_son($father, $nephew, $prefix1)
    26          $prefix = ('great',) * len($prefix1)

    27  cousins
    28      use cousins($cousin1, $cousin2, $distance, $removed)
    29      when
    30          uncle_nephew($uncle, $cousin1, $prefix1)
    31          father_son($uncle, $cousin2, $prefix2)
    32          $distance = min(len($prefixes1), len($prefixes2)) + 1
    33          $removed = abs(len($prefixes1) - len($prefixes2))

.. note::
   These rules_ draw the same conclusions as the forward-chaining_ example_,
   with the addition of the *brothers*, *uncle_nephew* and *cousins* rules.

We can draw something similar to a function call graph with these rules:

   Example Rules

These rules_ are not used until you ask Pyke to prove_ a goal.

The easiest way to do this is with *some_engine.prove_1* or
*some_engine.prove_n*.  Prove_1_ only returns the first proof found and
then stops (or raises ``pyke.knowledge_engine.CanNotProve``).  Prove_n_
returns a context manager for a generator that generates all possible proofs
(which, in some cases, might be infinite).  In both cases, you pass a tuple
of data arguments and the number of variable arguments as the last two
parameters.  The total number of arguments for the goal is the sum of the
length of the data arguments that you pass plus the number of variable
arguments that you specify.

Both functions return the variable bindings for the number of variable
arguments you specified as a tuple, along with the plan_.

Backtracking with Backward-Chaining Rules
=========================================

For this example, these are the starting set of ``family`` facts::

     1  son_of(tim, thomas)
     2  son_of(fred, thomas)
     3  son_of(bruce, thomas)
     4  son_of(michael, bruce)

And we want to know who fred's nephews are.  So we'd ask ``uncle_nephew(fred,
$nephew, $prefix)``.

Here are the steps (in parenthesis) in the inferencing up until the first
failure is encountered (with the line number from the example preceding each
line)::

    (1)   22  use uncle_nephew(fred, $nephew, $prefix)
              25  brothers(fred, $father)
    (2)           25  use brothers(fred, $brother2)
                      18  father_son($father, fred, ())
    (3)                   2  use father_son($father, fred, ())
                              4  family.son_of(fred, $father)
                      19  father_son(thomas, $brother2, ())
    (4)                   2  use father_son(thomas, $son, ())
                              4  family.son_of($son, thomas)
                      20  check fred != tim
              24  father_son(tim, $nephew, $prefix1)
    (5.1)         2  use father_son(tim, $son, ())
                      4  family.son_of($son, tim)                                => FAILS
    (5.2)         6  use father_son(tim, $grand_son, (grand))
                      8  father_son(tim, $grand_son, ())
                          2  use father_son(tim, $son, ())
                              4  family.son_of($son, tim)                        => FAILS
    (5.3)         11 use father_son(tim, $gg_son, (great, $prefix1, *$rest_prefixes))
                      13 father_son(tim, $gg_son, ())
                          2  use father_son(tim, $son, ())
                              4  family.son_of($son, tim)                        => FAILS

Each rule invocation is numbered (in parenthesis) as a step number.  Step 5
has tried 3 different rules and they have all failed (5.1, 5.2 and 5.3).

If you think of the rules as functions, the situation now looks like this
(the step numbers that succeeded circled in black, and steps that failed
circled in red):

.. figure:: ../../images/bc_backtracking.png
   :width: 590
   :height: 465
   :scale: 100
   :align: center

   We Need to Backtrack!

At this point, Pyke has hit a dead end and must backtrack.  The way that
backtracking proceeds is to go back up the list of steps executed, combining
the steps from all rules into one list.  Thus, when step 5 fails, Pyke backs
up to step 4 and tries to find another solution to that step.

If another solution is found, Pyke proceeds forward again from that point.  If
no other solutions are found, Pyke backs up another step.

When Pyke goes back to step 4, the next solution binds ``$son`` to ``fred``.
This fails the subsequent check in the ``brothers`` rule::

    20          check $brother1 != $brother2

And so Pyke goes back to step 4 once again.  The next solution binds ``$son``
to ``bruce``.  This succeeds for ``brother`` and is passed down to
``father_son`` which returns ``michael`` as ``fred's`` nephew.

Further backtracking reveals no other solutions.

Backtracking Summary
--------------------

Thus we see:

#. The backtracking_ algorithm: "**fail** goes *up* (or *back*) while
   **success** goes *down* (or *forward*)" is not limited to the steps within a
   *single* rule's ``when`` clause; but includes the *entire* chain of
   inferencing from the very start of trying to prove the top level goal.
#. This execution model is not available within traditional programming
   languages like Python.
#. The ability to go back to *any* point in the computation to try an
   alternate solution is where backward-chaining systems get their power!

Running the Example
========================

    >>> from pyke import knowledge_engine
    >>> import doc.examples
    >>> engine = knowledge_engine.engine(doc.examples.__file__)
    >>> engine.assert_('family', 'son_of', ('tim', 'thomas'))
    >>> engine.assert_('family', 'son_of', ('fred', 'thomas'))
    >>> engine.assert_('family', 'son_of', ('bruce', 'thomas'))
    >>> engine.assert_('family', 'son_of', ('michael', 'bruce'))
    >>> engine.activate('bc_example')

Nothing happens this time when we activate the rule base, because there are no
forward-chaining rules here.

We want to ask the question: "Who are Fred's nephews?".  This translates
into the Pyke statement: ``bc_example.uncle_nephew(fred, $v1, $v2)``.

.. note::
   Note that we're using the name of the rule base, ``bc_example`` rather than
   the fact base, ``family`` here; because we expect this answer to come from
   the ``bc_example`` rule base.

This is 'bc_example', 'uncle_nephew', with ('fred',) followed by 2 pattern
variables as arguments:

    >>> from __future__ import with_statement
    >>> with engine.prove_n('bc_example', 'uncle_nephew', ('fred',), 2) as gen:
    ...     for vars, no_plan in gen:
    ...         print vars
    ('michael', ())
