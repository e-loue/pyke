=======
Rules
=======

Conceptually, a rule is very simple::

    if
        A
        B
        C
    then
        D
        E

Meaning, "if A, B *and* C are true, then D and E are also true".  These are
often called *if-then* rules.

.. admonition:: And what are A, B, C, D and E?

   They are simply statements_.  Specifically, they are generalized statements
   containing patterns_ as arguments.  You'll see more about this later.

Premises and Conclusions
=================================

Rules have two parts to them: an **if** part (containing a list of statements
called the *premises*), and a **then** part (containing a list of statements
called the *conclusions*).

.. note::

   Pyke doesn't use the words **if** and **then**, as you'll see shortly.

Each of these **if** and **then** parts contain one or more facts_ or goals_
which are just generalized statements_ (meaning statements with patterns_ as
arguments).


Processing the Premises Within the *If* Clause
==============================================

Because each premise with the *if* clause is a generalized statement, the
premise is pattern matched to known facts.  This means that it may match more
than one fact.

Pyke tries all combinations of matching facts through a process called
*backtracking*.  This will cause the same rule to potentially succeed multiple
times, once for each unique combination of matching facts.

Backtracking
------------

Note that while processing the list of premises within a rule's ``if``
clause:

* If Pyke succeeds at proving a premise:

  * Pyke will proceed *down* to the next premise in the list.
  * Trying to proceed *down* from the *last* premise in the list (when it
    succeeds) causes the rule to *succeed*.

* If Pyke fails at proving a premise:

  * Pyke will back *up* to the prior premise in the list and try to find
    another solution for it.  The process starts over at the prior premise,
    going back down or further up the list depending on whether another
    solution can be found or not.
  * Trying to back *up* from the *first* premise in the list (when it fails)
    causes the rule to *fail*.

Thus, execution within each rule's ``if`` clause proceeds both backwards and
forwards, up and down the list of premises, depending on whether each
premise succeeds or fails.  The process of backing up within the ``if``
clause to try alternate solutions is called *backtracking*.

Inferencing
===========

Rules are specified individually within a `rule base`_.  They are not nested
or explicitly linked to each other.  So Pyke must automatically figure out
how to combine these rules to accomplish some larger task.  This is called
*inferencing* and there are two different approaches that Pyke uses:

- All forward-chaining_ rules are processed when a `rule base`_ is activated_.

  - Forward-chaining rules may assert_ new facts, and activate_ more specific
    `rule bases`_.

- Backward-chaining_ rules are processed when your program asks Pyke to
  prove_ a specific *goal* (i.e., asks Pyke a question_).

  - These rules are designed to answer a question rather than assert new
    facts or activate more specific rule bases.
  - They also have the ability to assemble Python functions into a customized
    call graph or program, called a plan_, to meet a specific need.

.. note::

   Forward-chaining and backward-chaining rules may both be included within
   the same `rule base`_.  Pyke knows the difference between forward-chaining
   and backward-chaining rules because they have different syntax_.
