==================
Forward Chaining
==================

Forward chaining rules_ are processed automatically as each `rule base`_ is
activated_.

When a rule base is activated_, all of its forward-chaining rules_ are run
in the order that they appear in the `.krb file`_ for that rule base.

Overview of Forward-Chaining
=============================

To do forward-chaining, Pyke finds rules whose *if* clause matches Pyke's list
of already known facts (the *if* clause may match, or *succeed*, multiple time;
see backtracking_).  Each time a rule succeeds, it *fires* this rule, which
adds the facts in the *then* clause of that rule to the list of already known
facts.

These new facts may fire other forward-chaining rules by matching their
*if* clause.  This can go on to any depth.  So Pyke ends up linking (or
*chaining*) the *then* clause of the first rule to the *if* clause of the next
rule.

.. note::

   Forward-chaining continues until no more rules_ can be fired.

Reviewing
----------

#. Pyke starts with the *if* clause of the first rule and checks to see if it
   matches the known facts.
#. If so, it proceeds to the *then* clause of that rule (*firing* the rule).
#. Which may link (or *chain*) to the *if* clause of another rule.

Since Pyke processes these rules from *if* to *then* to *if* to *then* in the
manner that we normally think of using rules, it's called *forward* chaining.

"Foreach", "Assert" Rather than "If", "Then"
============================================

Finally, since the statements within the *if* clause of the rule contain
patterns_; they may each match several facts.  In this case, the rule will
succeed and be fired multiple times.

The statements in the *then* clause of the rule also contain patterns.
Each time the rule is fired, the pattern variables within the *then*
statements are bound to different values so that different facts are asserted.

To avoid confusion, Pyke uses the words **foreach** and **assert** rather
than **if** and **then** for forward-chaining rules.  This is to suggest that
"for each" combination of facts matching the first list of statements,
the rule is fired to "assert" the facts in the second list of statements.

.. note::

   The use of **foreach** and **assert** identifies the rule as a
   forward-chaining rule.

Example
=======

This example will figure out the paternal ancestry of individuals given a list
of starting statements about who the sons of each father are.  (Daughters and
mothers are omitted to keep the example brief).  These facts are stored in a
`fact base`_ called ``family`` as ``son_of(son, father)``::

    1  son_of(michael, bruce)
    2  son_of(bruce, thomas)
    3  son_of(thomas, frederik)
    4  son_of(frederik, hiram)

We want to derive ``father_son`` relationships of the following form::

    father_son($father, $son, $prefix)

where

    :$son:
        is the name of the son (e.g., michael)
    :$father:
        is the name of the father (e.g., bruce)
    :$prefix:
        is a tuple of prefixes before the 'father' and 'son' titles to
        indicate the number of generations (e.g., ``()`` for direct
        father_son relationships, ``(grand)``, ``(great, grand)``, etc).

This is done using three forward-chaining rules.  Each rule is presented as a
separate step:

- `Step 1: Direct_father_son`_

  - Step 1 demonstrates the use of `pattern matching`_ to transfer values
    from one statement within the rule to another statement.

- `Step 2: Grand_father_son`_

  - Step 2 demonstrates backtracking_ within the premises_ of a
    forward-chaining rule.  Understanding this will help you to understand
    `backward-chaining rules`_.

- `Step 3: Great_grand_father_son`_

  - Step 3 demonstrates a recursive forward-chaining rule.

Finally, you will be shown how to `Run the Example`_ yourself.

Step 1: Direct_father_son
=========================

First we need to establish the direct father_son relationships (those whose
``$prefix`` is ``()``)::

     1  direct_father_son
     2      foreach
     3          family.son_of($son, $father)
     4      assert
     5          family.father_son($father, $son, ())

The Use of Pattern Variables
----------------------------

This demonstrates how `pattern variables`_ are used to transfer values from
one statement within a rule into another statement within the rule.

This rule has a single statement in its ``foreach`` clause (on line 3).  This
statement matches all four ``son_of`` facts, so the rule succeeds four times;
but with different bindings for the ``$son`` and ``$father`` pattern variables.
This causes different facts to be asserted when the same ``assert`` clause (on
line 5) is run four times; because each time line 5 is run, the values for
``$son`` and ``$father`` are transferred from the statement on line 3 to the
statement on line 5.

When the rule fires matching line 3 to::

    1  son_of(michael, bruce)

It runs line 5 to assert::

    5  father_son(bruce, michael, ())

And when the rule fires a second time matching line 3 to::

    2  son_of(bruce, thomas)

It runs line 5 a second time to assert::

    6  father_son(thomas, bruce, ())

The rule fires twice more for the remaining ``son_of`` facts, asserting
two more ``father_son`` relationships.  So this rule adds a total of four
new facts::

    5  father_son(bruce, michael, ())
    6  father_son(thomas, bruce, ())
    7  father_son(frederik, thomas, ())
    8  father_son(hiram, frederik, ())

Step 2: Grand_father_son
========================

Now we want to add grand son-father relationships.  We have a new rule for
this::

     6  grand_father_son
     7      foreach
     8          family.father_son($father, $grand_son, ())
     9          family.father_son($grand_father, $father, ())
    10      assert
    11          family.father_son($grand_father, $grand_son, (grand))

The Use of Backtracking
-----------------------

The ``grand_father_son`` rule_ is run for all combinations of ``father_son``
facts_ that satisfy the two ``foreach`` statements_ (on lines 8 and 9) and
asserts_ a ``(grand)`` ``father_son`` statement (on line 11) for each
combination.

This rule is a good example for backtracking_ and will help later in your
understanding of backtracking with backward-chaining_.  So let's follow the
backtracking in the execution of this rule.

The ``foreach`` clause has two statements (on lines 8 and 9) in it that are
both looking for ``father_son`` facts with a prefix of ``()``::

    8  family.father_son($father, $grand_son, ())
    9  family.father_son($grand_father, $father, ())

These will be matched to the following ``family`` facts (facts 5 through 8)::

    5  father_son(bruce, michael, ())
    6  father_son(thomas, bruce, ())
    7  father_son(frederik, thomas, ())
    8  father_son(hiram, frederik, ())

Pyke starts at the top of the list of premises and looks for a match for the
first premise (on line 8).  This matches fact 5, so the first premise
succeeds, binding ``$father`` to ``bruce``::

    8  family.father_son($father, $grand_son, ())    => fact 5, SUCCESS
    9  family.father_son($grand_father, $father, ())

*Success* means go *down*, so Pyke goes to the next premise on line 9.  This
succeeds with fact 6 (because ``$father`` is bound to ``bruce``)::

    8  family.father_son($father, $grand_son, ())    => fact 5
    9  family.father_son($grand_father, $father, ()) => fact 6, SUCCESS

*Success* means go *down*, but Pyke is at the end of the list of premises,
so the *rule* succeeds and Pyke fires the rule to assert::

    9  father_son(thomas, michael, (grand))

Since this is a forward-chaining rule, Pyke wants to get *all* of the answers
from it that it can, so it continues as if it had a failure (i.e., as if it's
not happy with this answer).

.. note::

   You'll see later that Pyke doesn't do this automatically with
   backward-chaining_ rules.

So Pyke *fails* back *up* to the second premise and looks for another
``father_son`` after fact 6 with ``bruce`` as the first argument.  This
fails::

    8  family.father_son($father, $grand_son, ())    => fact 5
    9  family.father_son($grand_father, $father, ()) => FAILS

*Fail* means go *up*, so Pyke goes up to the first premise and looks for
another ``father_son`` after fact 5, which succeeds for fact 6, binding
``$father`` to ``thomas``::

    8  family.father_son($father, $grand_son, ())    => fact 6, SUCCESS
    9  family.father_son($grand_father, $father, ())

*Success* means go *down*, so Pyke goes down to the second premise which
succeeds for fact 7::

    8  family.father_son($father, $grand_son, ())    => fact 6
    9  family.father_son($grand_father, $father, ()) => fact 7, SUCCESS

*Success* means go *down*, but Pyke is at the end of the list of premises,
so the *rule* succeeds and Pyke fires the rule to assert::

    10 father_son(frederik, bruce, (grand))

Then Pyke *fails* back *up* to the second premise, and continues looking for
another match after fact 7.  This fails::

    8  family.father_son($father, $grand_son, ())    => fact 6
    9  family.father_son($grand_father, $father, ()) => FAILS

*Fail* means go *up*, so Pyke goes back to the first premise and continues
looking for another match after fact 6.  (Since fact 7 is just like the last
case, we'll skip matching fact 7 and go straight to the last fact, fact 8).
The match to fact 8 succeeds, binding ``$father`` to ``hiram``::

    8  family.father_son($father, $grand_son, ())    => fact 8, SUCCESS
    9  family.father_son($grand_father, $father, ())

*Success* means go *down*, so Pyke goes to the second premise and looks for a
``father_son`` for ``hiram``.  This fails::

    8  family.father_son($father, $grand_son, ())    => fact 8
    9  family.father_son($grand_father, $father, ()) => FAILS

*Fail* means go *up*, so Pyke goes back up to the first premise and looks for
another match after fact 8.  There are no more facts, so this fails::

    8  family.father_son($father, $grand_son, ())    => FAILS
    9  family.father_son($grand_father, $father, ())

*Fail* means go *up*, but Pyke is at the top of the list of premises,
so the *rule* fails and Pyke is done processing it.

.. important::

   Note that the *last* statement in the ``foreach`` clause may *succeed*
   multiple times (which fires the ``assert`` clause multiple times).

   But the *first* statement in the ``foreach`` clause may only *fail* once.
   When that happens, the whole rule fails and the show's over for this rule!

So running the ``grand_father_son`` rule results in addition of these three
facts::

    9  father_son(thomas, michael, (grand))
    10 father_son(frederik, bruce, (grand))
    11 father_son(hiram, thomas, (grand))    (this is the one we skipped)

Step 3: Great_grand_father_son
==============================

Finally, we want to add great(...) grand son-father relationships.  We have
a final rule for this::

    12  great_grand_father_son
    13      foreach
    14          family.father_son($father, $gg_son, ())
    15          family.father_son($gg_father, $father, ($prefix1, *$rest_prefixes))
    16      assert
    17          family.father_son($gg_father, $gg_son,
                                    (great, $prefix1, *$rest_prefixes))

.. note::

   Note how the $prefixes for the statement on line 15 are specified as
   ``($prefix1, *$rest_prefixes)``, rather than just ``$prefix``.
   This is done so that it does *not* match ``()``.  (But it will still match
   ``(grand)`` by binding ``$rest_prefixes`` to ``()``).

This is the only rule that can be recursive.  As this rule asserts_ new facts_,
those facts may be used by the same rule (by matching the statement on line
15) to produce even more great, great, ... ``father_son`` relationships.

Recursive Rules
---------------

Running this rule normally will assert the following two facts::

    12 father_son(frederik, michael, (great, grand))
    13 father_son(hiram, bruce, (great, grand))

But, since these facts may also be used by the same rule (on line 15), Pyke
checks each one by trying to run the rule again just for that new fact.

Trying this for the first new fact: ``father_son(frederik, michael,
(great, grand))`` fails to find anything because ``michael`` is not a father.

Trying this for the second new fact: ``father_son(hiram, bruce, (great,
grand))`` results in one more new fact::

    14 father_son(hiram, michael, (great, great, grand))

Now this last new fact is tried again with this rule, which fails again
because ``michael`` is not a father.

So at this point Pyke is finished with this rule.  The rule ended up firing
three times, asserting::

    12 father_son(frederik, michael, (great, grand))
    13 father_son(hiram, bruce, (great, grand))
    14 father_son(hiram, michael, (great, great, grand))


Running the Example
===========================

.. This code is hidden.  It will add '' to sys.path, change to the doc.examples
   directory and store the directory path in __file__ for the code section
   following:
   >>> import sys
   >>> if '' not in sys.path: sys.path.insert(0, '')
   >>> import os
   >>> os.chdir("../../../examples")
   >>> __file__ = os.getcwd()

These rules could be run as follows:

    >>> from pyke import knowledge_engine
    >>> engine = knowledge_engine.engine(__file__)
    >>> engine.assert_('family', 'son_of', ('michael', 'bruce'))
    >>> engine.assert_('family', 'son_of', ('bruce', 'thomas'))
    >>> engine.assert_('family', 'son_of', ('thomas', 'frederik'))
    >>> engine.assert_('family', 'son_of', ('frederik', 'hiram'))
    >>> engine.activate('fc_example')     # This is where the rules are run!
    >>> engine.get_kb('family').dump_specific_facts()
    father_son('bruce', 'michael', ())
    father_son('thomas', 'bruce', ())
    father_son('frederik', 'thomas', ())
    father_son('hiram', 'frederik', ())
    father_son('thomas', 'michael', ('grand',))
    father_son('frederik', 'bruce', ('grand',))
    father_son('hiram', 'thomas', ('grand',))
    father_son('frederik', 'michael', ('great', 'grand'))
    father_son('hiram', 'bruce', ('great', 'grand'))
    father_son('hiram', 'michael', ('great', 'great', 'grand'))
    son_of('michael', 'bruce')
    son_of('bruce', 'thomas')
    son_of('thomas', 'frederik')
    son_of('frederik', 'hiram')
