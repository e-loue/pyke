==========================
Logic Programming Tutorial
==========================

Pyke is an inference engine that applies rules_ to facts_ to establish
additional facts (through forward-chaining_ rules), and/or to prove *goals*
and optionally assemble Python functions
into customized call graphs, called plans_ (through backward-chaining_ rules).

Pyke may then be reset_, deleting the last set of facts, so that the cycle
may be repeated.  For each cycle a different rule base may be activated_.

The plan_ capability allows the postponement of code execution until the
top-level goal has been completely proven.  This shields the code from
blind alleys and the backtracking_ that occurs within the rules.

Once a plan_ has been created, it may be executed multiple times with different
arguments.  It may also be pickled_, and later run again only requiring one
small Pyke module.

Pyke also provides an end user question_ capability, as well as the capability
to run commands_ on the local system to guide the inferencing.
