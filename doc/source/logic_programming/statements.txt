===========
Statements
===========

A *statement* is a statement of fact, also just called a *fact*.  They are
the bread and butter of Pyke.  Statements are the data values that Pyke acts
upon.

You might also think of a statement as a spoken sentence.  For example, the
Pyke family_relations_ example deals with sentences like::

    "Bruce is the son of Thomas (his father) and Norma (his mother)."

But we condense the sentence down to it's essence.  In this case, the sentence
revolves around three things: Bruce, Thomas and Norma.  All of the rest of the
words can be condensed into a single identifier that identifies the
relationship between these three things::

    son_of(Bruce, Thomas, Norma)

We can give these condensed sentence structures any names that we want.  In
this case, I chose ``son_of``.  I might have also chosen "parents_of", which
might conjure the following English sentence::

    "The parents of Bruce are Thomas (his father) and Norma (his mother)."

Or::

    "Bruce's parents are Thomas (his father) and Norma (his mother)."

But the ``son_of`` form carries the additional information that Bruce is a son
rather than a daughter.  So this is the form used in the family_relations
example.

.. caution:: Statements are not functions!
   When we wear our Python hats, ``son_of(Bruce, Thomas, Norma)`` looks like a
   function call!  We might expect that it can be executed to *do* something
   and possibly return a value.  But when we wear our Pyke hats, this is just
   a statement, or a piece of data.  It doesn't *do* anything and it **never**
   returns a value!

Note that it makes perfect sense to have several statements defining the same
relationship between their arguments::

    son_of(Bruce, Thomas, Norma)
    son_of(Michael, Bruce, Marilyn)
    son_of(David, Bruce, Marilyn)

But this only makes sense if they have different arguments.  There is never a
need to state the same fact twice.  Thus we can never establish two facts (two
statements) that are identical.  If we try to do this, the second one is
silently ignored.

So::

    son_of(Bruce, Thomas, Norma)
    son_of(Bruce, Thomas, Norma)
    son_of(Bruce, Thomas, Norma)

is exactly the same as::

    son_of(Bruce, Thomas, Norma)

Finally, we see that the position of each argument is important.  In our
``son_of`` example, the meaning of each argument is::

    son_of(son, father, mother)

Thus, changing the order of the arguments changes the meaning of the
statement.  So::

    son_of(Bruce, Thomas, Norma)

and::

    son_of(Bruce, Norma, Thomas)

mean different things!  The first statement says that Thomas is the father of
Bruce, but the second statement says that Norma is the father!

Syntactic Structure of Statements
=================================

So we see that statements in Pyke are very structured.

Pyke categorizes statements into `knowledge bases`_.  You create knowledge
bases to help you organize your statements.  A *knowledge base* in Pyke
roughly corresponds to a *module* in Python.

.. note::
   Pyke does not allow knowledge bases to contain other knowledge bases, only
   information about statements.  Thus, there is only one level of knowledge
   bases; and beneath each knowledge base, one level of statements. 

So statements have three components:

#. The name of a knowledge base.  For example, ``family``.
#. The name of a *knowledge entity*.  For example, ``son_of``.
#. The statement arguments.  These are just Python data.  Currently in Pyke,
   there is a push for these arguments to be immutable.

The syntax for a statement looks like this::

    statement ::= IDENTIFIER '.' IDENTIFIER '(' {argument,} ')'

Knowledge Base
--------------

The first IDENTIFIER is the name of the knowledge base.  In our
family_relations example, this is ``family``.

.. note::
   You'll see that within `backward-chaining rules`_, the name of the
   knowledge base may be omitted.  It defaults to the currently selected
   `rule base`_ for this `rule base category`_.  You'll learn more about this
   later.

Knowledge Entity
----------------

The second IDENTIFIER is the name of the *knowledge entity*.  This is the
relationship between the arguments.  You could also think of this as the
statement *type* or *topic*.  For example, ``son_of`` is a *type* of statement
with three arguments: (son, father, mother).  Or the (son, father, mother)
arguments are about the *topic* ``son_of``.

Arguments
---------

The arguments can be any simple Python data value (numbers, strings, None,
True or False) or tuples of these values (including nested tuples).
Currently, statements are supposed to be immutable, so all of the arguments
are immutable.  The arguments relate to the topic, above, to make a complete
statement.

.. note::
   Prolog_ allows arguments to be other statements (functors).  But Pyke needs
   to integrate into Python and Python has no concept of a "statement".  So we
   just use tuples in Pyke because Python is very happy with tuples!

So the complete statement for our family_relations example is::

    family.son_of(Bruce, Thomas, Norma)
