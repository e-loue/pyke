Tuple Patterns
================

Tuple patterns only match tuples.  They are written as simply a comma
separated list of patterns within parenthesis::

    (1, $x, "buckle my shoe")

You can also write a *rest* pattern variable at the end using an asterisk
(``*``)::

    ($a, fie, $b, *$c)

This will match the rest of the items in the data value that the tuple pattern
is matched to.  Note that the *rest* pattern variable is *always* bound to a
tuple.

Examples:

    - matching ``(1, $x, "buckle my shoe")`` to ``(1, 2, "buckle my shoe")``
      matches, binding ``$x`` to 2.
    - matching ``(1, $x, "buckle my shoe")`` to ``(1, 2, "buckle my belt")``
      does not match because the third pattern within the tuple pattern fails
      to match the third value in the matched tuple.
    - matching ``($a, fie, $b, *$c)`` to ``(fee, fie, foe, fum)``
      matches, binding ``$a`` to ``fee``, ``$b`` to ``foe`` and ``$c`` to
      ``(fum)``.
    - matching ``($a, fie, $b, *$c)`` to ``(fee, fie, foe)``
      matches, binding ``$a`` to ``fee``, ``$b`` to ``foe`` and ``$c`` to
      ``()``.
    - matching ``($a, fie, $b, *$c)`` to ``(fee, fie)`` does not match because
      the data value has to have a length of at least three.

.. hint::
   You can use ``(*$foo)`` to only match a tuple.  It will bind ``$foo`` to
   the entire tuple, but will fail to match any other data type.
