Pattern Variables
=================

To take this to the next level, you might want to ask "Who are the sons of
Thomas and Norma?".  In this case, you are passing ``Thomas`` and ``Norma``
*into* Pyke, and you'd like Pyke to pass something back *out* to you as part of
the answer (in addition to the thumbs up).

Pattern variables serve as output parameters.  They start with a ``$``::

    family.son_of($son, Thomas, Norma)

You can use whatever name you like after the ``$``.  Pyke will answer with a
thumbs up *binding* ``$son`` to ``Bruce``.  If you don't like that answer, you
can reject that answer and ask Pyke for another answer ("nope, try again!").
Each time Pyke finds another son for Thomas and Norma, it answers with another
thumbs up and ``$son`` *bound* to a different value.

If you reject the last son of ``Thomas`` and ``Norma`` (or if ``Thomas`` and
``Norma`` have no sons in the first place), Pyke will answer with a thumbs
down.

We say that Pyke *binds* ``Bruce`` to the pattern variable ``$son`` when it
comes back with its first thumbs up.  When we tell Pyke "nope, try again!",
Pyke must first *unbind* ``$son`` before it can go on and *bind* it to the
next value.  The "nope" part does the *unbinding*, and the "try again" part
does the *binding* again to a new value.

So at any point in time, a pattern variable is either *bound* to a value or
*unbound*.  If we follow a particular pattern variable through time, we might
see that it is alternately bound and unbound many times as Pyke tries to find
a suitable answer to your question.  Specifically, when Pyke comes back with
the final thumbs down, ``$son`` is unbound.

Anonymous Pattern Variables
===========================

Suppose we want to know who Norma's sons are?  In this case we don't care
about the father.  We use *anonymous variables* as "don't care" placeholders.

An anonymous variable is any pattern variable who's name starts with an
underscore (``_``).  The rest of the name doesn't matter and just serves as
documentation (and so ``$_`` is all that's strictly needed).

So "Who are Norma's sons?" looks like::

    family.son_of($son, $_father, Norma)

We're giving Norma as input to Pyke, and asking for the ``$son`` as output and
telling Pyke that we don't care about the ``$_father``.

Anonymous variables are never bound to values.  (So you could say that they
are always unbound).

Pattern Variable Identity
===========================

Now this is very important, so pay attention!  The same pattern variable
*name* means the same *pattern variable*.  Thus, if you say ``$son`` twice,
it's the *same* pattern variable.  And, a pattern variable can only be bound
to one value (at a time), so you mean the *same* data value must appear in
both places.

.. note::
   This does *not* apply to `anonymous pattern variables`_.  Since they are
   never bound to a value, each use of the same anonymous variable can match
   different data values.

So if you wanted to see all of the sons with the same name as their fathers,
you would ask::

    family.son_of($father, $father, $_mother)

.. note::

   The Pyke family_relations_ example never uses the same name for both
   father and son because that would cause confusion about which of them
   was the father to both of their sons and daughters.
   
   In these cases, it modifies the name of the son to make it unique.

   Thus, this question would always fail within the family_relations
   example...

And so here is the complete explanation of how pattern variables are matched
to a data value.

First, the pattern variable is checked to see if it is already bound to a
value.

If it is bound to a value, then this bound value has to match the data for
the match to succeed.

If it is unbound, then the pattern variable is bound to the data value as a
by-product of doing the match, and the match always succeeds.

And so pattern variables only "match any value" when they are unbound.  And in
matching that value, they become bound to it as a by-product of doing the
match.  Once bound to a value, a pattern variable will only match that value
(much like a literal pattern).
