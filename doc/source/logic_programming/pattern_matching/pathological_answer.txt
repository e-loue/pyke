Pathological Answer
====================

This is the answer to the following question:

Pathological Question
=====================

What is the bound value of pattern variable ``$y`` after matching the
following two tuple patterns:

    Tuple pattern A:
        ``((ho, $_, ($a, $a)), ($a, $a, $b), ($a, *$b))``
    Tuple pattern B:
        ``($x, $x, $y)``

Answer
======

Let's take this step by step, matching each element of the two tuple patterns
in turn.

#. Match ``(ho, $_, ($a, $a))`` to ``$x``.

   This succeeds with the following binding:
   
   ``$x``:
       ``(ho, $_, ($a, $a))``

#. Match ``($a, $a, $b)`` to ``$x``.

   Because ``$x`` is bound to a value, this becomes the same as matching:

   - ``($a, $a, $b)`` to
   - ``(ho, $_, ($a, $a))``

   Which succeeds, binding:

   ``$a``:
       ``ho``
   ``$b``:
       ``($a, $a)``

   ``$_`` is an anonymous variable, so it is not bound (or bound to).

#. Match ``($a, *$b)`` to ``$y``.

   Because both ``$a`` and ``$b`` have bound values, this becomes the same as
   matching:

   - ``(ho, ho, ho)`` to
   - ``$y``

   Which succeeds, binding:

   ``$y``:
       ``(ho, ho, ho)``

So the overall match succeeds with the following bindings:

   ``$x``:
       ``(ho, $_, ($a, $a))``
   ``$a``:
       ``ho``
   ``$b``:
       ``($a, $a)``
   ``$y``:
       ``(ho, ho, ho)``

And so ``$y`` is ``(ho, ho, ho)``!

   If you got this right, you should really be using Pyke!
