=====================
Matching Two Patterns
=====================

You've now seen all of the different kinds of patterns and how they are
matched to data.  Not too bad so far...

Patterns are used to generalize statements.  One situation where you need to
generalize a statement is when you want to ask a question.  That's been
covered above.

The other situation where you need to generalize a statement is when you write
rules_, which are explained later.

But rules also need to be able to match one pattern to another *pattern*,
and not just match patterns to *data* as we have discussed so far.

So before we can move on to rules, we need to examine how one pattern is
matched to another pattern.

The short answer is that it all comes down to pattern variables and that
pattern variables may not only be bound to *data*, but may also be bound to
other *patterns*.

Binding to a Literal Pattern
============================

Binding a pattern variable to a literal pattern is just like binding it to the
data within that literal pattern.  Nothing fancy here!

Binding to Another Pattern Variable
=====================================

When pattern variable A is bound to pattern variable B, they essentially
become the *same pattern variable*.  Basically, pattern variable A *becomes*
pattern variable B (or, you might say, *defers* to pattern variable B).

Let's say that pattern variable A has been bound to pattern variable B and
that pattern variable B is still unbound.

#. Prior to binding pattern variable B to a value, it doesn't matter whether
   you ask if pattern variable A is bound or pattern variable B is bound, the
   answer is False for both.

#. It doesn't matter whether you match pattern variable A to a value or
   pattern variable B to a value.  In both cases, it is pattern variable B
   that gets bound to this value.

#. And once pattern variable B is bound to a value, it doesn't matter whether
   you ask for the bound value of pattern variable A or pattern variable B,
   you will get the same value.

So for all intents and purposes pattern variable A and pattern variable B
become the same pattern variable.

Binding to a Tuple Pattern
===========================

Because pattern variables may be bound to tuple patterns, the term *fully
bound* is introduced.  Asking whether the pattern variable is *fully bound*
means that not only is it bound to a value (the tuple pattern), but that all
of the subordinate patterns (recursively) within the tuple pattern are also
bound to values.

Being *fully bound* means that the bound value of the pattern variable can be
converted into standard Python data without any pattern variables in it.  This
is important when Pyke wants to talk to Python because Python has no concept
of storing *variables* within its data structures.


Pathological Question
=====================

What is the bound value of pattern variable ``$y`` after matching the
following two tuple patterns:

    Tuple pattern A:
        ``((ho, $_, ($a, $a)), ($a, $a, $b), ($a, *$b))``
    Tuple pattern B:
        ``($x, $x, $y)``

The answer is here_ (but no peeking!).
